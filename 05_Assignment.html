    <h3>Q.2 What is a Bootstrap Container, and how does it work?</h3>
    <pre>
        In Bootstrap, a Container is a basic layout element that wraps content and provides a consistent width and padding. 
        It's used to contain and organize content, such as text, images, and other elements.

        Here's how it works:
        
        1. Width: The Container has a maximum width, which is determined by the screen size (e.g., xs, sm, md, lg, xl). 
        This ensures that content doesn't exceed the screen width.
        2. Padding: The Container adds padding to its content, creating a buffer zone between the content and the edge of the screen.
        3. Margin: The Container has a margin to separate it from other elements on the page.
        4. Responsive: Containers are responsive, meaning their width and padding adjust based on the screen size.
        
        Types of Containers:
        
        1. .container: A fixed-width container with a maximum width and padding.
        2. .container-fluid: A full-width container that takes up the entire screen width, with no maximum width.
        
        Using Containers:
        
        1. Wrap your content in a <div> element with the class container or container-fluid.
        2. Add rows and columns inside the Container to create a grid layout. 
        Example:
        <!-- <div class="container"> -->
          <!-- <div class="row"> -->
            <!-- <div class="col-md-6">Content</div> -->
            <!-- <div class="col-md-6">Content</div> -->
          <!-- </div> -->
        <!-- </div> -->
    </pre>

    <h3>Q.3 What are the default Bootstrap text settings?</h3>
    <pre>
        Bootstrap's default text settings include:

        1. Font Family: Open Sans, Arial, sans-serif
        2. Font Size: 16px (1rem)
        3. Line Height: 1.5 (24px)
        4. Color: #333333 (dark gray)
        5. Text Alignment: Left
        6. Margin Bottom: 1rem (16px)
        7. Font Weight: Normal (400)
        8. Font Style: Normal (not italic)
        
        Additionally, Bootstrap sets the following text element styles:
        
        1. Headings (h1-h6): Larger font sizes, bold font weight, and margin bottom
        2. Paragraphs (p): Margin bottom
        3. Links (a): Blue color, underline, and hover effects
        4. Strong (strong): Bold font weight
        5. Emphasis (em): Italic font style
        
        These default settings can be overridden using custom CSS or Bootstrap's utility classes.
    </pre>

    <h3>Q.4 What do you know about the Bootstrap Grid System?</h3>
    <pre>
        The Bootstrap Grid System is a powerful tool for creating responsive and flexible layouts. Here's what I know about it:

        Key Components:
        
        1. Containers: The grid system is built within containers, which provide a consistent width and padding.
        2. Rows: Rows are horizontal containers that hold columns.
        3. Columns: Columns are vertical containers that hold content.
        
        Grid Structure:
        
        1. 12-column grid: Bootstrap's grid is based on a 12-column structure, allowing for flexible and responsive layouts.
        2. Column widths: Columns can be set to specific widths using pre-defined classes
         (e.g., col-md-6 for a medium-sized column that takes up 6 columns).
        
        Grid Classes:
        
        1. xs: Extra small devices (less than 576px)
        2. sm: Small devices (576px to 768px)
        3. md: Medium devices (768px to 992px)
        4. lg: Large devices (992px to 1200px)
        5. xl: Extra large devices (greater than 1200px)
        
        Grid Utilities:
        
        1. Offsetting: Move columns to the right using offset classes (e.g., offset-md-3).
        2. Nesting: Place rows and columns inside other columns.
        3. Column ordering: Change column order using order- classes.
        
        Responsive Design:
        
        1. Breakpoints: Bootstrap's grid system uses breakpoints to adapt layouts to different screen sizes.
        2. Responsive classes: Use classes like col-md-6 to apply styles only at specific breakpoints.
        
        Customization:
        
        1. Custom grid classes: Create custom grid classes using Sass variables.
        2. Grid options: Modify grid settings, such as the number of columns or gutter width.
        
        The Bootstrap Grid System provides a robust and flexible foundation for building responsive and mobile-first layouts.
    </pre>

    <h3>Q.5 What is the difference between Bootstrap 4 and Bootstrap 5</h3>
    <pre>
        Bootstrap 4 and Bootstrap 5 are two major versions of the popular front-end framework, with several differences:

        1. Grid System:
        * Bootstrap 4: Uses a 4-tiered grid system (xs, sm, md, lg)
        * Bootstrap 5: Introduces a new 5-tiered grid system (xs, sm, md, lg, xl)
        
        2. CSS Preprocessor:
        * Bootstrap 4: Uses Less as the CSS preprocessor
        * Bootstrap 5: Switches to Sass (SCSS) for better compatibility and customization
        
        3. Browser Support:
        * Bootstrap 4: Supports Internet Explorer 10+ and modern browsers
        * Bootstrap 5: Drops support for Internet Explorer and focuses on modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
        
        4. jQuery Dependency:
        * Bootstrap 4: Requires jQuery for JavaScript components
        * Bootstrap 5: Removes jQuery dependency, using vanilla JavaScript instead
        
        5. New Components and Utilities:
        * Bootstrap 5 introduces new components (e.g., offcanvas, toast) and utilities (e.g., CSS variables, improved spacing)
        
        6. Improved Accessibility:
        * Bootstrap 5 enhances accessibility features, such as better screen reader support and keyboard navigation
        
        7. Customization and Theming:
        * Bootstrap 5 simplifies customization with a new theming system and improved Sass variables
        
        8. Migration:
        * Bootstrap 5 is not fully compatible with Bootstrap 4; migration requires updates to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code
        
        In summary, Bootstrap 5 offers a new grid system, improved customization options, and enhanced accessibility features, 
        while removing jQuery dependency and Internet Explorer support.

    <h3>Q.6 What is a Button Group, and what is the class for a basic Button Group?</h3>
    <pre>
        A Button Group is a container that holds multiple buttons together, allowing them to be displayed as a single unit. 
        It's often used for grouping related actions or options.

        The class for a basic Button Group in Bootstrap is:
        
        .btn-group
        
        This class is used to wrap a series of buttons, making them behave as a single unit. You can then add additional 
        classes to customize the appearance and behavior of the Button Group, such as:
        - .btn-group-vertical for a vertical button group
        - .btn-group-sm or .btn-group-lg for smaller or larger buttons
        - .btn-group-justified for justified button groups
        Example:

        <div class="btn-group">
          <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Button 1</button>
          <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Button 2</button>
        </div>
                
    </pre>

    <h3>Q.7 How can you use Bootstrap to make thumbnails?</h3>
    <pre>
        To create thumbnails using Bootstrap, you can use the .img-thumbnail class on an <img> element.
        This class adds a simple border and padding to the image, making it look like a thumbnail.

        Example:
        
        <img src="image.jpg" alt="Thumbnail" class="img-thumbnail">
        
        You can also use the .thumbnail class on a container element, such as a <div>, to 
        create a thumbnail-like container that can hold an image or other content.
        
        <div class="thumbnail">
          <img src="image.jpg" alt="Thumbnail">
          <div class="caption">Thumbnail caption</div>
        </div>
        
        Additionally, you can use Bootstrap's grid system to create a thumbnail gallery with multiple images.
        
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-3">
            <div class="thumbnail">
              <img src="image1.jpg" alt="Thumbnail 1">
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-3">
            <div class="thumbnail">
              <img src="image2.jpg" alt="Thumbnail 2">
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-3">
            <div class="thumbnail">
              <img src="image3.jpg" alt="Thumbnail 3">
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>        
    </pre>

    <h3>Q.8 In Bootstrap 4, what is flexbox?</h3>
    <pre>
        In Bootstrap 4, Flexbox is a layout mode that allows you to create flexible and responsive layouts using the Flexible Box Layout Module (CSS Flexbox).

        Bootstrap 4 uses Flexbox to create a flexible and responsive grid system, navigation, and other components. Flexbox enables you to:
        
        1. Create flexible containers that adapt to their content
        2. Align and justify content horizontally and vertically
        3. Distribute space between items
        4. Create responsive layouts that adjust to different screen sizes
        
        Bootstrap 4's Flexbox utilities include classes like:
        - .d-flex to create a flexible container
        - .flex-wrap to wrap items
        - .justify-content-* to justify content (e.g., .justify-content-center)
        - .align-items-* to align items (e.g., .align-items-center)
        - .flex-grow-* to control item growth

        Flexbox is used in various Bootstrap 4 components, such as:
        - Grid columns
        - Navigation bars
        - Alerts
        - Buttons
    </pre>
    <h3>Q.9 How can one create an alert in Bootstrap?</h3>
    <pre>
        To create an alert in Bootstrap, you can use the .alert class, along with optional modifier classes to customize the alert's appearance and behavior.

        Basic Alert:
        
        <div class="alert" role="alert">
          This is a basic alert!
        </div>
        
        Alert with Modifier Classes:
        
        <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
          This is a primary alert!
        </div>
        
        Available modifier classes:
        - .alert-primary
        - .alert-secondary
        - .alert-success
        - .alert-danger
        - .alert-warning
        - .alert-info
        - .alert-light
        - .alert-dark
        
        Dismissable Alert (with close button):
        
        <div class="alert alert-dismissible fade show" role="alert">
          <strong>Holy guacamole!</strong> You should check in on some of those fields below.
          <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="alert" aria-label="Close">
            <span aria-hidden="true">&times;</span>
          </button>
        </div>
        
        Note: The role="alert" attribute is important for accessibility, as it indicates to screen readers that the element is an alert.
        
        You can also use JavaScript to create and dismiss alerts dynamically.        
    </pre>
    <h3>Q.10 What is a bootstrap card and how would you create one?</h3>
    <pre>
        A Bootstrap card is a flexible and extensible content container that can be used to display a wide range of content, such as text,
        images, videos, and more. It's a versatile component that can be used to create a variety of UI elements, like blog posts, product showcases, or user profiles.

        To create a basic Bootstrap card, you can use the following HTML structure:

        <div class="card">
          <img src="image.jpg" class="card-img-top" alt="Card image">
          <div class="card-body">
            <h5 class="card-title">Card title</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content.</p>
            <a href="#" class="btn btn-primary">Button</a>
          </div>
        </div>

        This code creates a basic card with:
        - An image at the top (card-img-top)
        - A body container (card-body) with:
            - A title (card-title)
            - Some text (card-text)
            - A button (btn btn-primary)
        
        You can customize the card further by adding additional classes, such as:
        
        - card-header for a header section
        - card-footer for a footer section
        - card-group to group multiple cards together
        - card-columns to create a masonry-style layout
        
        Bootstrap also provides various utility classes to customize the card's appearance, such as:
        
        - text-center to center the text
        - bg-primary to change the background color
        - border-primary to change the border color
        
        By combining these classes, you can create a wide range of card styles and layouts to suit your needs.
